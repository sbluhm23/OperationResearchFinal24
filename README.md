IE 3311/5318 Project Description
For the semester project, students are asked to form teams of at most three members. (I strongly
recommend teams with 3 students and might merge smaller teams together.) Remember that this
project constitutes 20% of your final grade, so pick your teams wisely! Please make sure to submit
your Team Selection Form and Final Report by September 23rd and December 4th, respectively.
Here is a preliminary project description:
Suppose you are an Operations Researcher at the Organ Procurement and
Transplantation Network (OPTN). You have been hired as a Kidney Paired Donation
(KPD) consultant for the KPD Pilot Program to help with the live donation process in
the United States. Given a data set, your task is to develop a KPD plan to maximize the
number of compatible transplantations. KPD seeks to match one patient and their
incompatible donor with another patient and donor in the same situation for kidney
exchange.
For example, Jennifer wants to donate her kidney to her brother, John. Sam wants to
donate his kidney to his colleague, Brandon. Unfortunately, Jennifer cannot donate to
John because she is blood type A, and John is blood type B. Sam cannot donate to
Brandon because he is blood type B, and Brandon is blood type A. Fortunately, Jennifer
is a match for Brandon, and Sam is a match for John.
